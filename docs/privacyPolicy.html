            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Aurora! This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you interact with our bot.</p>

            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>We may collect the following data:</p>
            <ul id="privacyPolicyList">
            <li>- Discord username and user ID</li>
            <li>- Messages and commands sent to the bot</li>
            <li>- Any other data you provide during interactions with the bot</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Data Usage</h3>
            <p>We use your data to:</p>
            <ul id="privacyPolicyList">
            <li>- Provide and improve the functionality of the bot</li>
            <li>- Maintain and troubleshoot the bot</li>

After finishing the command, all associated data will no longer be used or stored
                Other than that we only use data that is provided by discord directly.
